Melodique
=========

Melodique is one of my first ventures into musical programming. It uses
simple music theory concepts to generate short melodic phrases. The melodic
phrases are rendered visually using the HTML5 canvas, and audio output is
produced by a built-in virtual analog sound synthesis engine. This project is 
distributed under a modified BSD license.
